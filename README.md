# Genre-Scraper
A data mining project to scrape the genres of every number one hit from 1958. Created to practically utilise python/SQL knowledge as well as to demonstrate data cleaning and  scraping. I was also quite curious to map the death of Rock music.

## Technologies
* Python 3.7
* SQLite 3
* Pandas
* MatPlotLib
* Selenium

## General Info

Once the data is collected it is then cleaned both automatically and manually, the manual changes to genre names as well as genres of songs that were unable to be found are saved so they can be applied automatically.
I then decided to plot the 10 most popular genres over the years in a stack plot to give a neat visual representation of the trends in popularity of different genres over time.
The most interesting output for this was that it allowed me to pinpoint the decline of rock music and the rise of hip hop/rap.
